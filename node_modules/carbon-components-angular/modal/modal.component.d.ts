/**
 * Component to create modals for presenting content.
 *
 * [See demo](../../?path=/story/modal--basic)
 *
 * Using a modal in your application requires `ibm-placeholder` which would generally be
 * placed near the end of your app component template (app.component.ts or app.component.html) as:
 *
```html
<ibm-modal-placeholder></ibm-modal-placeholder>
```
 *
 * A more complete example for `Modal` is given as follows:
 *
 * Example modal definition:
 *
```typescript
@Component({
    selector: "app-sample-modal",
    template: `
                <ibm-modal size="xl" (overlaySelected)="closeModal()">
                    <ibm-modal-header (closeSelect)="closeModal()">Header text</ibm-modal-header>
                        <section class="modal-body">
                            <h1>Sample modal works.</h1>
                            <button class="btn--icon-link" nPopover="Hello there" title="Popover title" placement="right" appendInline="true">
                                <ibm-icon icon="info" size="sm"></ibm-icon>
                            </button>
                            {{modalText}}
                        </section>
                    <ibm-modal-footer><button ibmButton="primary" (click)="closeModal()">Close</button></ibm-modal-footer>
                </ibm-modal>`,
    styles: [``]
})
export class SampleModal extends BaseModal {
    modalText: string;
    constructor(protected injector: Injector) {
        super();
        this.modalText = this.injector.get("modalText");
    }
}
```
 *
 * Example of opening the modal:
 *
```typescript
@Component({
    selector: "app-modal-demo",
    template: `
                <button ibmButton="primary" (click)="openModal('drill')">Drill-down modal</button>
                <ibm-placeholder></ibm-placeholder>`
})
export class ModalDemo {
    openModal() {
        this.modalService.create({component: SampleModal, inputs: {modalText: "Hello universe."}});
    }
}
```
